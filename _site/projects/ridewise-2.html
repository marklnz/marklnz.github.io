  <h1 id="ridewise-2">Ridewise 2</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Ridewise 2 project was initially conceived as a way for the New Zealand Government department responsible for the Total Mobility scheme to take more direct control of the processing of Total Mobility refund claims from the taxi operators.</p>

<p>Ridewise 2 was to be built around a real-time trip update process, where trips taken by users of the Total Mobility scheme would be sent from the taxi directly, as they are taken. This differs from Ridewise 1 where trips are uploaded afterwards, often overnight in batches, by the taxi operators. This batch process in Ridewise 1 is time consuming and error prone, as many of the operators use copy+paste to build the trip data files before sending them.</p>

<p>Along the way, Ridewise 2 was intended to also improve the reliability and performance of the user interface, as the existing Ridewise 1 application is slow, and contains elements of less than optimal usibility.</p>

<p>Thus, it was decided to write a ground up replacement for Ridewise 1, utilising a more advanced and scalable architecture, along with a modern user experience.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/projects/ridewise2.jpg" alt="preview" /></p>

<h2 id="technical-overview">Technical Overview</h2>

<p>Ridewise 2 is built using the latest .net framework, .net 6. It is designed around a microservices architecture hosted on Microsoft Azure, with a separate API for real time trip data.</p>

<p>The services are all built in C# as ASP.Net Core WebAPIs, each with their own independent Azure SQL database, and use an event-driven approach to domain data persistence. Service to service communication is performed using a RabbitMQ message queue server as an event hub, and all services expose RESTful service interfaces.</p>

<p>The web client is built using C# with Microsoftâ€™s Blazor Web Assembly SPA framework, again on .net 6.</p>

<h2 id="my-involvement">My Involvement</h2>

<p>Having been technical lead of the <a href="./ridewise-1">Ridewise 1</a> project since 2013, I was seen as the obvious person to also lead the replacement project.</p>

<p>I was initially tasked with designing the real time trip processing API, which in fact was ultimately deployed to production in 2019 for use in speeding up trip processing for Ridewise <em>1</em>. At this point, there was little appetite from existing customers for a full replacement application, so the process of attempting to find new customers began. My part in this included a trip to Australia to present the Ridewise concept to the government of the state of Victoria. This, along with a number of expressions of interest from other customers in New Zealand, ultimately led to Ridewise 2 being designed as a modular, multi-tenant application.</p>

<p>Development began with this design in mind, however the sales pipeline dried up and so the focus of the application was narrowed to the original scope of simply replacing Ridewise 1 with a more performant, more scalable and future proof application.</p>

<p>I have been involved since the beginning of the project, as the architect, UI designer, and lead developer for the team. Ridewise 2 is scheduled for release in 2022.</p>
