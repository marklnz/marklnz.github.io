# **About Me**

Hi! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I love designing and building both front end (websites) and back end (APIs) software. I have over 25 years of experience in software development, working for organisations ranging in size from multinational enterprises to a small start-up. I have a wide range of experience and technical expertise working primarily with C#/.net based software and web applications, as well as both Angular and React websites, and leading teams in implementing solutions on those platforms. I have worked on projects ranging in size and complexity, in a variety of different industries.

I had set up a profile on <i>CodersRank.io</i> to detail my skills, experience and ongoing coding contributions but unfortunately that site appears to have become a victim of time, and no longer appears functional. In case that site does make a comeback, however, the link to my CodersRank profile is <a href="https://profile.codersrank.io/user/marklnz" target="_blank">here</a>.

The following is a summary of some of my more recent experience and skills I've used in these roles. For a more complete picture, my resume is available to view or download <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
