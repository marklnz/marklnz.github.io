      I was the Tech lead on the engineering team responsible for Boardmaker, a special education solution which facilitates learning and communication for students with communication difficulties. Boardmaker is used by over 900,000 users and over 700,000 educational institutions globally.
      I was responsible for the architecture and technical direction of the suite of Boardmaker applications, and maintaining technical documentation. In this role, I led the team in efforts to modernize the software, updating the installed desktop apps from an Electron based solution to .Net MAUI.
      I also initiated work to begin modernizing many of the server-side and back office tools from their legacy frameworks to more modern versions, principally from older .Net versions to .Net 8 and 9, and from older React versions to more current versions.
      I also acted as technical liaison for other teams, attending weekly meetings led by the director of software engineering, where all product engineering teams met to discuss current work, and to coordinate efforts across teams.
