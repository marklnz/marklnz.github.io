  description: Team lead, architect and software engineer. 
               I'm a full stack software developer and architect responsible for leading in-house software development team at Eyede, working predominantly with Microsoft technologies on complex web based applications.
               I oversee and collaborate with the other senior developers in developing Eyede's next generation multi tier web application architecture using Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML 5 and CSS 3, backed with WebAPI components using ASP.Net Core, Entity Framework Core and SQL Server. 
               I have overseen, and provided hands-on assistance in building the developer tooling and CI components for this next generation web architecture with Node.js, Gulp, Bower and Karma, with Visual Studio Online hosted build servers.

  description: .Net Solutions Architect
               I was a senior member of Optimation's C# development team.
               I built Optimation’s reusable .net software architecture and reference implementation, using ASP.Net MVC in C#, along with SQL Server Entity Framework for data persistence, utilising Domain Driven Design and Command Query Responsibility Segregation principles, with front end web pages built using ASP.Net MVC, HTML5, Javascript with jQuery and CSS3 with Bootstrap. 
               I served as technical lead and architect on .net projects for Optimation, all built on the archetype "reference architecture" using the technologies listed above.
               I configured, administered and managed Optimation’s Team Foundation Server environment, including process customization and end user training.
