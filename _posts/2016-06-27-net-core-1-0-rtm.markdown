So, with the countdown to the release of .net core 1.0 nearly over (livestream the keynote from DevNation [here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Linux/DevNation-2016)), I'm looking forward to having a fixed target for my upgrade from RC1. 

Should be a good bit of fun, but there's a lot that's changed in the meantime, and it's worth noting that the Visual Studio tooling is still going to be a preview. The tooling isn't due to RTM until the Visual Studio '15' release, and I expect that a bunch of stuff related will also not be fully baked yet - I'm looking at YOU Entity Framework 7.

Still, it's a good chance to catch up as there'll be a stable target to aim at. I have a small sample .net core based API, which supports user authentication and authorization and uses OAuth 2.0 flows, passing data to the client using JWT tokens. This project also uses EF 7 and serves as a proof of concept and testbed for a range of design ideas I've used successfully on other projects (CQRS, Event Sourcing, a hybrid document database store solution built on top of SQL Server, etc.).

So I'm going to work through upgrading this to the RTM over the next little while and see how it goes!
