I recently read a thought provoking [post from the awesome Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GitHubActivityGuiltAndTheCodersFitBit.aspx) where he ponders on what a prospective recruiter, or potential future work/team mate might be able to learn about a coder from their GitHub activity graph. 

It's an interesting one, potentially if you're job hunting, or looking to promote yourself and gain acceptance in a coding community for whatever reason, then perhaps you might care about this.

There are a number of reasons why I believe that such a graph should be taken with a grain of salt, and Scott's post touches on most of them. There is one though that he doesn't mention - the fact that this chart is open to being "gamed" - it's possible to "fake" contributions so that the chart makes you look busier than you actually were.

According to GitHub, a commit will count, for example (and I'm simplifying a lot here), if it was made in the master branch of a standalone repository, where you've opened a pull request or issue. There are no requirements around the amount of code changed, nor the nature of the impact of that change on the codebase itself.

So all I'd have to do to fake it then, for example, is to add some whitespace (or at least, make some trivial change) to a single file in a repository of my own devising, and commit it to master either with a pull request, or having first created a bogus issue on that repo. 

Granted, if you did that 50 times a day your chart would look impressive, but largely unbelievable and this behaviour would be easy to see through. However the point still stands - modify this simplistic padding approach a bit, don't do TOO many, and mix it with a reasonable number of actual changes, and you'd be hard to tell from a genuine "hard core contributor". 

So I guess for this reason, and for all the reasons Scott mentioned, I'd never place too much emphasis on a person's GitHub contributions chart.
